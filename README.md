Project Title: Snake-Water-Gun Game Implementation
Date: [2/2/2024]

Description:
This project involves the implementation of a Snake-Water-Gun game. The game is designed to be
played against the computer, and the user can input their choice as Snake (0), Water (1), or Gun (2).
Approach/Algorithms:
The game utilizes a simple algorithm to determine the winner based on the user&#39;s and computer&#39;s
choices. The algorithm checks for draws, user wins, and computer wins according to the specified
rules. Random module is the Mersenne Twister algorithm, which is designed to have a long period
(meaning it takes a long time before it repeats the same sequence of numbers) and good statistical
properties. The Mersenne Twister algorithm is widely used in practice and provides a good balance
between speed and statistical quality for many applications, including simulations, cryptography,
and, in this case, generating random numbers for various purposes in Python programming.

Test Procedures:
Testing was conducted by playing the game multiple times with varying user inputs and verifying the
outcomes against expected results. Error handling for invalid inputs was also tested.

Results:
The Snake-Water-Gun game produced the following results in [number of games played] rounds:
- User Wins: [Number of user wins]
- Computer Wins: [Number of computer wins]
- Draws: [Number of draws]

Conclusion/Remarks:
The implementation of the Snake-Water-Gun game demonstrates the application of basic
programming concepts. The game successfully handles user input, random computer choices, and
determines the winner based on predefined rules.
